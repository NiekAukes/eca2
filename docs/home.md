Welcome to the NECA wiki!

This wiki is a collection of information about the NECA project. It is intended to be a resource for users of the NECA framework.

## Where to start?
We recommend you to read the [README](/NiekAukes/eca2) first. Then after that, the [Event System](event_system.md) page is a good place to start learning about the NECA framework. Another option is to start with the tutorials, more info on that can be found in the README.
