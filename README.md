# NECA - the Successor of ECA (Event-Condition-Action)
NECA is a simple Python library that allows you to create event-driven applications. It is inspired by the [ECA (Event-Condition-Action) paradigm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_condition_action). NECA is a successor of [ECA](https://github.com/utwente-db/eca) and is built on top of [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/).

NECA is specialized for creating web dashboards. It allows you to easily create a web server with a dashboard that can be updated real-time. It also allows you to easily add new functionality to your dashboard.
