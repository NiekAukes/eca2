"""
The "events" module provides a flexible event handling system for managing and handling events within your application.

Events are a fundamental part of many software systems, allowing different parts of your code to communicate and respond to specific occurrences or triggers. This module offers a set of tools to manage events, define event handlers, and emit events within your application.

Most used functions and decorators:
- @event(key): A decorator for event handlers. Functions decorated with @event(key) will be called when "fire_global(key, context)" is invoked with the specified key. It attaches the event to the global rules object.

- @condition(condition): Sets a condition for an event handler. It attaches the condition to the global rules object.

- fire_global(eventname, data, delay=None): Emits a global event with the given name in the global context. All functions annotated with @event(key) are called with the provided context.

- fire_all(eventname, data, delay=None): Emits an event with the given name in every context. All functions annotated with @event(key) are called for each context.

- create_context(name=None, ruleset=None): Creates a new context and returns it. You can specify the ruleset to use for this context, and optionally, provide a name. If no ruleset is specified, the global ruleset is used.

- emit(event, data, id=None): Emits a new event to the outside world, typically to a web browser. You can specify the event name, data (convertible to JSON through json.dumps), and an optional identifier.

Example Usage:
```python
from events import Ruleset, event, fire_global, create_context, emit

# Define event handlers
@event("user_login")
def handle_login(context, event_data):
    # Handle user login event
    pass

# Emit a global event
fire_global("user_login", {"user_id": 123})

# Emit an event to the outside world (browser)
emit("browser_event", {"message": "Hello, world!"})
```
